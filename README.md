# Ansible

Using this repository to learn Ansible/Terraform concepts.

Currently, the scope of this is to build a repeatable process to tear down and build back up a public hosted forum that can be moved between AWS regions in the case of a disaster recovery scenario.

This repository is to be used with my Terraform repository.

# To-Do

* Take .yml files and build out roles so that the phpbb forum is a role, not the exclusive code.
